Developers can encrypt entire disks or specific partitions, extend encryption to new nodes, rotate keys, and remove encryption as needed. 

Zettaset's Virtual Enterprise Key Manager (V-EKM) and Virtual Hardware Security Module (V-HSM) are available, separately, as scalable, software-based key management and hsm solutions that are fully integrated with XCrypt Full Disk.
